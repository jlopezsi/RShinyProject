NYC Data Science R Shiny Project 

Using historical San Francisco Uber/Lyft pick-up/drop-off data from the San Francisco Transportation Authority 
I designed a Shiny app for the San Francisco Bay area rideshare drivers that recommends a destination at which they will likely 
find passengers for pick-up to drop-off quicker more efficiently. The recommendation is based on the day of the week, time,  
and selecting either pick-up or drop-off. 

Here is a blog post I wrote about the project and results: http://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/uber-lyft-maximization:-more-money-for-the-time/

Here is a link to the R Shiny app: https://laurentaylor.shinyapps.io/RShinyProject/

The data is a free data set available on sfcta's Github: https://github.com/sfcta/tncstoday; https://www.sfcta.org/emerging-mobility/tncs-today
